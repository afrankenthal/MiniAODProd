# Running from Tarball in cmslpc

This is a small tool to privately generate RunIISummer16MiniAODv2 events from a standard CMS gridpack (i.e. the output has to be a cmsgrid_final.lhe file).

## Installation
1. Please fork the following package and branch in your dedicated area:
```bash
git clone -b cmslpc-80X git@github.com:SiewYan/running_from_tarball.git
```
2. Modify ```submit.py``` if you desire to store auxiliary files (log,out,err) elsewhere.
3. Specify your base directory [$TARBALL](https://github.com/SiewYan/running_from_tarball/blob/lpc-dev-eos/buildInputs.sh#L5) where job folder will be created.
4. Point to your output [location](https://github.com/SiewYan/running_from_tarball/blob/cmslpc-80X/submit/runEventGeneration.sh#L146) which is currently set to group lpcmetx EOS space in cmslpc.
5. Number of event per job can be adjusted [here](https://github.com/SiewYan/running_from_tarball/blob/cmslpc-80X/submit/runEventGeneration.sh#L17).

## Submit to condor cmslpc

### Submit on a single gridpacks

1. Put your tarball/gridpack into the ```inputs/``` folder together with an appropriate hadronizer that has the same name.
2. Additionally, comment [line](https://github.com/SiewYan/running_from_tarball/blob/cmslpc-80X/buildInputs.sh#L8) and uncomment [line](https://github.com/SiewYan/running_from_tarball/blob/cmslpc-80X/buildInputs.sh#L9) to point to ```inputs/```.
3. Prepare and submit by running, $njob --> number of jobs:
```bash
sh buildInputs.sh EWKZ2Jets_ZToLL_M-50_13TeV-madgraph-pythia8
python submit.py work_EWKZ2Jets_ZToLL_M-50_13TeV-madgraph-pythia8 $njobs
```

### Submit on multiple gridpacks

1. Specify the [location](https://github.com/SiewYan/running_from_tarball/blob/cmslpc-80X/multibuild.sh#L6) (absolute path) of your gridpacks.
2. Revert step specify in (2) in **Submit on a single gridpacks** to put to your pre-defined EOS space.
2. Adjust the number of [jobs](https://github.com/SiewYan/running_from_tarball/blob/cmslpc-80X/multibuild.sh#L11) desire to produce, for example, if 100 events produced per job, 2500 jobs would have 250000 events.
3. Pre-define your grid password in [auto](https://github.com/SiewYan/running_from_tarball/blob/cmslpc-80X/auto#L3) to facilitate hassle-free passwordless job preparation. WARNING: please mask/remove your password once job setup is done to avoid exposure to unscrupulous individual.
4. Run the setup

```bash
./multibuild.sh
```

4. After the setup, please check the content of	```multisubmit.sh```. If its all good,	submit!!

```bash
./multisubmit.sh
```

5. Monitor!! with cmslpc landscape [dashboard](https://landscape.fnal.gov/lpc/dashboard/db/user-batch-summary?refresh=5m&orgId=1&var-cluster=cms-lpc&var-user=shoh).
6. Bon Voyage.

## Signal generation  era
1. Below list the current configuration of 80X era for the signal generation, in the future event this will been to be changed according for 92X era.

```bash

#GEN-SIM generation --> 
CMSSWRELEASE : CMSSW_7_1_20_patch3
SCRAM_ARCH   : slc6_amd64_gcc481
conditions   : MCRUN2_71_V1::All

#AOD and MiniAODv2 generation --> 
CMSSWRELEASE : CMSSW_8_0_21
SCRAM_ARCH   : slc6_amd64_gcc530
conditions   : 80X_mcRun2_asymptotic_2016_TrancheIV_v6

```
2. Also, pileup files too --> https://github.com/SiewYan/running_from_tarball/blob/cmslpc-80X/inputs/pu_files.py
